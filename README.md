# Confusion-Matrix-Explained


In machine Learning, Classification is the process of categorizing a given set of data into different categories.
In Machine Learning, To measure the performance of the classification model we use the confusion matrix.

**Confusion Matrix**

A confusion matrix is a matrix that summarizes the performance of a machine learning model on a set of test data.
It is often used to measure the performance of classification models, which aim to predict a categorical label for each input instance.
The matrix displays the number of true positives (TP), true negatives (TN), false positives (FP), and false negatives (FN) produced by the model on the test data.
